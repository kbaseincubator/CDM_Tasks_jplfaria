# Supplementary Table S2 - Carbon Source Growth Data

**Source**: Price et al. (2018) Nature 557:503-509, Supplementary Tables
**URL**: https://genomics.lbl.gov/supplemental/bigfit/Supplementary_Tables_final.xlsx

## Data Description

- **28 organisms** tested on **95 carbon sources** (96 minus water control)
- Values:
  - **Growth**: Positive for growth on the indicated carbon substrate with the wild-type bacterium OR a successful genome-wide mutant fitness assay was done
  - **No Growth**: No growth on the indicated carbon substrate with the wild-type bacterium

## Important Note

**A call of "No Growth" does not necessarily mean that the bacterium does not grow on a given substrate.**

From the paper:
> "Our threshold for TRUE growth is somewhat conservative. In addition, alternative conditions (for example, lower concentrations or different base media) could support growth."

## Column Names

Columns use Fitness Browser organism IDs (short names) rather than full species names.
See `organism_metadata.csv` for mapping between IDs and full species names.

## Data Quality

This is **curated** gold-standard data from the BigFIT paper, more reliable than raw Fitness Browser data.
