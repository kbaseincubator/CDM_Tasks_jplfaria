Bacterial metabolism of scFOS is well documented: GH32 fructofuranosidases (exo-/endo-inulinase, sucrose/invertase) hydrolyze scFOS to sucrose and fructose, which then enter standard sucrose/fructose utilization pathways (e.g., invertase/sucrose phosphorylase, fructokinase, glycolysis or bifid shunt in bifidobacteria).

Commercial products with similar naming are typically soluble prebiotic fibers (often resistant dextrin/soluble corn fiber or inulin/FOS); for GEMs, a well-defined proxy is dextrin/maltodextrin, which maps to established maltodextrin transport and catabolism reactions.

Its bacterial metabolism (transport plus β-galactosidase hydrolysis to galactose/glucose followed by the Leloir/tagatose-6P pathways or the bifid shunt in bifidobacteria) is well documented for B-GOS (e.g., Tzortzis et al., 2005; Vulevic et al., 2015), but in GEMs it cannot be represented as one exchange metabolite.

Most commercial 'prebiotic' products are primarily inulin-type fructans/FOS or GOS; these are hydrolyzed by gut bacteria to monosaccharides prior to central metabolism (e.g., Bifidobacterium via β-fructofuranosidases for FOS/inulin; Lactobacillus via similar GH32 enzymes), so a tractable proxy is D-fructose as the terminal hydrolysis product of inulin/FOS.

However, it is not present in common GSM compound libraries (BiGG/ModelSEED) and KEGG pathway annotations for general bacteria are sparse; experimental utilization appears limited to specialized taxa, making broad modeling support impractical.

Bacterial utilization of isomalto-oligosaccharides proceeds via alpha-glucosidases/dextranases within starch and sucrose metabolism (KEGG map00500; MetaCyc carbohydrate degradation pathways; CAZy GH13/GH31 families), so a defined proxy such as isomaltose can be modeled.

While gut bacteria do ferment resistant dextrins via alpha-glucan degradation pathways to maltodextrins/maltose/glucose, genome-scale models require defined metabolites; a practical proxy is to supply maltodextrin oligomers (e.g., maltotriose) rather than a single “Promitor” exchange.
