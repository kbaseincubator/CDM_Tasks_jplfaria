# Notebook 04 Status - Where We Left Off

## Date: 2025-10-16

## What Was Completed

### 1. Models with Missing Exchanges Created ✅

**Script**: `add_exchanges_optimized.py` (completed in 0.9 seconds)

**Output**:
- `models_missing_exchanges/` directory with 28 corrected models
- `results/model_corrections_log.csv`

**Summary**:
- 28 organisms corrected
- 33 total exchanges added:
  - Fe2+ (cpd10515): 14 models
  - Ni2+ (cpd00244): 14 models
  - Molybdate (cpd11574): 5 models

**Most Important Corrections**:
- **Pseudomonas putida KT2440**: +Fe2+ (was 19.6% accuracy, 37 FNs)
- **Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron**: +Ni2+ +Molybdate (was 10% accuracy, 18 FNs)
- **Paraburkholderia graminis OAS925**: +Fe2+ (was 41.5% accuracy, 31 FNs)
- **Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021**: +Fe2+ (was 57.3% accuracy, 28 FNs)

### 2. Notebook 04 Created ✅

**File**: `04-add-missing-exchanges-and-rerun.ipynb`

**Structure**:
- Cells 1-16: Model correction workflow (COMPLETED via script)
- Cells 17-20: Re-run FBA simulations (NOT YET RUN)
- Cells 21-36: Analysis and comparison (NOT YET RUN)

---

## What Remains To Be Done

### Step 1: Re-run FBA Simulations with Corrected Models

**Notebook 04, starting at Cell 20**

**What to run**:
1. Cell 2: Import libraries
2. Cell 8: Load organism metadata (`organism_metadata`)
3. Cell 10: Define `models_with_exchanges_dir` path
4. Cell 18: Load carbon sources (`simulatable`)
5. Cell 20: **RUN FBA SIMULATIONS** (~2.5 hours for 5,324 simulations)

**What Cell 20 does**:
- Loops through all 44 organisms × 121 carbon sources = 5,324 simulations
- For each organism:
  - Checks if corrected model exists in `models_missing_exchanges/`
  - If yes: uses corrected model
  - If no: uses original model from CDMSCI-198
- Runs FBA for each carbon source
- Saves results to `results/fba_simulation_results_corrected.csv`

**Expected runtime**: ~2.5 hours

### Step 2: Complete Notebook 04 Analysis

**Cells 21-36**

**What these cells do**:
1. **Cell 21-22**: Save corrected results to CSV
2. **Cell 23-28**: Calculate corrected confusion matrix and metrics
3. **Cell 29-30**: Compare before vs after (side-by-side table)
4. **Cell 31-32**: Save corrected metrics and comparison
5. **Cell 33-34**: Per-organism improvement analysis
6. **Cell 35-36**: Summary report

**Expected outputs**:
- `results/fba_simulation_results_corrected.csv` (5,324 rows)
- `results/classification_metrics_corrected.json`
- `results/before_after_comparison.csv`
- `results/per_organism_improvement.csv`

**Expected improvements** (conservative estimates):
- FN count: 571 → 230-285 (-286 to -341)
- Recall: 43.1% → 65-75% (+22-32%)
- Accuracy: 63.3% → 78-82% (+15-19%)

## How to Resume Notebook 04

When you're ready to continue:

### Option A: Run Interactively in Jupyter

1. Open `04-add-missing-exchanges-and-rerun.ipynb`
2. Run these cells in order:
   - Cell 2 (imports)
   - Cell 8 (organism metadata)
   - Cell 10 (define paths)
   - Cell 18 (load carbon sources)
   - Cell 20 (FBA simulations - THE BIG ONE)
   - Cells 21-36 (analysis)

### Option B: Run Cell 20 as Standalone Script

If you prefer to run the simulations as a script (so you don't need to keep Jupyter open), I can extract cell 20 into a standalone Python script that:
- Runs all 5,324 simulations
- Shows progress bar
- Saves results
- Takes ~2.5 hours

Then you can run cells 21-36 in Jupyter later for analysis.

## Notebook 05 Plan

**File**: `05-comprehensive-final-analysis.ipynb` (NOT YET CREATED)

### Objective

Comprehensive analysis of corrected models with publication-quality visualizations and insights.

### Scope

All analyses from Notebook 02 but with corrected models, plus additional analyses:

1. **Overall Performance Comparison**
   - Before/after confusion matrices (side by side)
   - Before/after metrics (bar charts)
   - Per-organism improvement ranking
   - Per-carbon source improvement

2. **Threshold Sensitivity Analysis**
   - Test multiple biomass flux thresholds: 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1
   - Plot accuracy/recall curves
   - Identify optimal threshold

3. **Taxonomy-Based Analysis**
   - Group organisms by:
     - Gram stain (+/-)
     - Aerobe/Anaerobe
     - Phylum
   - Compare performance across groups
   - Identify systematic biases

4. **Chemical Class Analysis**
   - Group carbon sources by chemical class:
     - Sugars (monosaccharides, disaccharides)
     - Amino acids
     - Organic acids
     - Alcohols
     - Amino sugars
   - Performance by chemical class
   - Identify which classes are well/poorly modeled

5. **Missing Exchange Impact Analysis**
   - Stratify organisms by:
     - Has all 3 metals (Fe2+, Ni2+, Molybdate)
     - Missing 1 metal
     - Missing 2+ metals
   - Show improvement for each group
   - Quantify exchange addition benefit

6. **Remaining False Negatives Deep Dive**
   - Analyze the ~230-285 remaining FNs after correction
   - Which organisms still struggle?
   - Which carbon sources still problematic?
   - What pathways are likely missing?

7. **Publication-Quality Visualizations**
   - Confusion matrix heatmaps (before/after)
   - Organism performance heatmap (clustered)
   - Carbon source performance heatmap (clustered)
   - Improvement distribution plots
   - ROC curves (if applicable)
   - Chemical class performance bars

8. **Interactive Viewers**
   - HTML table with sortable/filterable results
   - Per-organism drill-down
   - Per-carbon source drill-down

### Expected Outputs

**Results files**:
- `results/threshold_sensitivity.csv`
- `results/taxonomy_performance.csv`
- `results/chemical_class_performance.csv`
- `results/remaining_false_negatives_analysis.csv`

**Visualizations**:
- `results/before_after_confusion_matrix.png`
- `results/organism_improvement_heatmap.png`
- `results/carbon_class_performance.png`
- `results/threshold_sensitivity_curve.png`
- `results/organism_performance_heatmap_clustered.png`

**Interactive**:
- `results/final_results_viewer.html`

### Expected Runtime

- Notebook creation: 1-2 hours (for me to create)
- Notebook execution: 30-60 minutes (mostly plotting)
- No additional FBA simulations needed (uses Notebook 04 results)

---

## Key Findings So Far (from Notebooks 01-03)

### Root Cause Identified
- **ALL 571 False Negatives** have biomass_flux = 0 (complete pathway absence)
- **33 missing exchange reactions** across 23 organisms correlate with high FN rates:
  - Fe2+ missing: +12.5% higher FN rate
  - Molybdate missing: +19.2% higher FN rate
  - Ni2+ missing: +5.0% higher FN rate

### Gap-Filling Limitation
- Gap-filling (CDMSCI-198) added **ZERO** of these 33 exchanges
- All missing exchanges present in BOTH draft AND gap-filled models
- Gap-filling optimized for pyruvate growth only, didn't ensure broad metabolic capability

### Organisms Most Affected
1. Pseudomonas putida KT2440: 37 FNs (80.4% FN rate) - missing Fe2+
2. Paraburkholderia graminis: 31 FNs (58.5% FN rate) - missing Fe2+
3. Pseudomonas simiae WCS417: 29 FNs (38.2% FN rate) - no missing metals!
4. Sinorhizobium meliloti: 28 FNs (37.3% FN rate) - missing Fe2+
5. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron: 18 FNs (90% FN rate) - missing Ni2+ + Molybdate

### Carbon Sources Poorly Modeled
- Amino sugars: D-Glucosamine (32% accuracy), N-Acetyl-glucosamine (27%)
- Disaccharides: D-Trehalose (35%), D-Raffinose (68%)
- Some rare sugars: L-Sorbose, L-Fucose

## Timeline Estimate

**If continuing now**:
- Notebook 04 completion: 3 hours (2.5h simulations + 0.5h analysis)
- Notebook 05 creation: 1-2 hours (for me)
- Notebook 05 execution: 0.5-1 hour
- README update: 0.5 hour
- **Total**: 5-6.5 hours

**If resuming later**:
- Can pick up exactly where we left off
- All models already created
- Just need to run simulations and analysis

## Questions to Consider for Notebook 05

1. **Threshold**: Should we stick with 0.001 or optimize it?
2. **Taxonomy data**: Do we have phylum/gram stain info for all 44 organisms?
3. **Chemical classes**: Should I auto-classify or do you want to provide a mapping?
4. **Additional analyses**: Anything specific you want to see?
5. **Publication target**: What journal/audience? (affects figure style)
