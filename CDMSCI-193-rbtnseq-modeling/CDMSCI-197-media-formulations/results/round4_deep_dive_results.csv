6-O-Acetyl-D-glucose,UNMAPPED,unmappable,,True,"1) Chemical structure: 6-O-Acetyl-D-glucose is D-glucose in which the primary hydroxyl at C6 (the CH2OH group) is esterified with an acetyl (CH3CO–) group, yielding an acetate ester at the O6 position. In solution, the sugar exists predominantly as α/β-D-glucopyranose anomers (hemiacetal at C1), and acetylation at O6 does not alter the stereocenters at C2–C5. Functional groups include: an acetate ester at O6, multiple secondary alcohols (C2–C4, anomeric OH at C1 in the cyclic forms), and a hemiacetal (pyranose ring). The expected neutral molecular formula is C8H14O7 (D-glucose, C6H12O6, plus an acetyl group net addition of C2H2O due to replacement of an OH hydrogen), corresponding to a nominal mass of ~222.2 g/mol. 2) Database search strategy: I considered exact names and synonyms: “6-O-Acetyl-D-glucose,” “D-glucose 6-acetate,” “6-acetyl-D-glucose,” “Glc-6-OAc,” “6-acetoxy-D-glucopyranose,” and anomer-specific names (“6-O-acetyl-α-D-glucopyranose,” “6-O-acetyl-β-D-glucopyranose”). I also checked for broader variants (removing stereochemical or hyphenation differences), base compound matches (“D-glucose”), and related acetylated sugars commonly present in metabolic databases (e.g., N-acetyl-D-glucosamine). ModelSEED generally includes biologically common metabolites (glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, GlcNAc) but rarely includes free O-acetylated monosaccharide esters, which are mainly synthetic or occur transiently in glycochemistry rather than central metabolism. 3) ModelSEED mapping: There appears to be no direct ModelSEED entry for an O6-acetyl ester of D-glucose. While the parent compound D-glucose is present, mapping to it would lose the ester functional group, change mass and charge behavior, and misrepresent reactivity and transport, so it is not a faithful substitute. Structurally similar entries like N-acetyl-D-glucosamine differ fundamentally (amide at C2 vs. ester at O6). 4) Decision: UNMAPPABLE. The compound lacks an exact or close structural match in ModelSEED, and using a parent compound would be misleading unless the modeling context explicitly abstracts away acetylation. If a model requires a placeholder, D-glucose could be a pragmatic approximation with strong caveats, but that should be a manual, context-dependent choice."
D-Gluconic Acid sodium salt,UNMAPPED,unmappable,,True,"D-Gluconic acid sodium salt is the sodium salt of D-gluconic acid, commonly referred to as sodium D-gluconate or simply sodium gluconate. Chemically, gluconic acid (C6H12O7) is the aldonic acid derived from D-glucose by oxidation of the aldehyde at C1 to a carboxylic acid. The sodium salt is formed by deprotonation of the acid (giving the gluconate anion, C6H11O7−) and association with Na+, yielding the neutral salt with expected empirical formula C6H11NaO7. Functional groups include a carboxylate (–COO−) at C1 and five hydroxyl groups along the hexanoate chain (polyol). Typical synonyms: sodium gluconate; D-gluconate sodium; sodium 2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoate. In metabolic databases and genome-scale models (including ModelSEED), metal salts are generally not represented as distinct organic compounds; instead, the organic anion (here, gluconate/D-gluconate) is represented separately from the inorganic cation (Na+). ModelSEED therefore is expected to have an entry for gluconate (often without explicit D/L stereochemistry) with a pH 7 formula approximating C6H11O7− and charge −1, and a separate entry for sodium ion. The prior suggestion of “cpd00257” appears to conflate KEGG compound numbering (C00257 corresponds to D-gluconate in KEGG) with ModelSEED IDs; thus it fails if your template does not include that exact ModelSEED identifier. Given ModelSEED’s conventions, the appropriate mapping strategy is to map this request to the parent metabolite “gluconate” (or “D-gluconate” if stereospecific entries exist) and note that the sodium counterion is handled separately as Na+. Because I cannot verify the exact ModelSEED compound ID for gluconate in your specific template without database access, I mark the compound as UNMAPPED but recommend substituting the non-salt parent metabolite (gluconate) plus sodium ion where needed. This preserves stoichiometry and is standard practice in flux models. Manual review is advised to select the exact gluconate entry present in your ModelSEED template and to confirm whether stereochemistry is distinguished."
D-Glucuronic Acid,UNMAPPED,unmappable,,True,"Chemical structure: D-Glucuronic acid is the C6-oxidized sugar acid of D-glucose. In its open-chain form it is an aldohexuronic acid (aldehyde at C1, carboxylic acid at C6), and in solution it predominantly exists as α/β-D-pyranose forms with a carboxylic acid at C6 and multiple hydroxyls. Expected molecular formula for the acid is C6H10O7 (glucose is C6H12O6; oxidation at C6 adds one oxygen and removes two hydrogens). Functional groups include one carboxylic acid (pKa ~3–3.5), five hydroxyl groups, and ring hemiacetal in cyclic forms (or an aldehyde in the minor open-chain tautomer). Database search strategy: In ModelSEED, acids are generally represented as their predominant pH 7 species, so the entry is usually named “D-glucuronate” (the anion, formula C6H9O7−) rather than “D‑glucuronic acid.” Search using synonyms: D-glucuronic acid, D-glucuronate, glucuronic acid, glucuronate, GLCUR, D-GlcUA; exclude salts/hydrates (e.g., sodium D-glucuronate). Verify stereochemistry (D vs L) and avoid confusion with related sugar acids: gluconate (C1 oxidation) and glucarate/saccharate (C1 and C6 dicarboxylate). Also check parent/related metabolites: UDP-D-glucuronate and D-glucuronolactone. ModelSEED typically has D-glucuronate; however, I cannot confidently provide the numeric ModelSEED ID offline. The previously suggested cpd00257 appears incorrect (not found or mismatched), so I recommend locating the entry via the ModelSEED compound browser by the synonyms above and confirming its charge, formula (C6H9O7−), and stereochemistry. Decision: APPROXIMATE, because the correct ModelSEED representation is almost certainly the deprotonated D-glucuronate rather than the acid, but I cannot verify the exact cpd##### number from memory. This warrants manual confirmation to avoid conflation with gluconate or glucarate and to ensure D-specific stereochemistry."
Dodecandioic acid,UNMAPPED,unmappable,,True,"1) Chemical structure: Dodecandioic acid is almost certainly intended to be dodecanedioic acid (IUPAC: dodecane-1,12-dioic acid), the C12 straight-chain alpha,omega-dicarboxylic acid with structure HOOC-(CH2)10-COOH. It is a saturated, linear dicarboxylic acid with two terminal carboxyl groups and no stereocenters. Expected neutral formula is C12H22O4 (two carboxyls: 4 O total; 10 internal methylenes contribute 20 H plus 2 acidic OH H). Common synonyms include dodecanedioic acid, 1,12-dodecanedioic acid, dodecane-1,12-dioic acid, DCDA, and DDDA. The conjugate base at physiological pH is dodecanedioate(2−). A canonical SMILES is O=C(O)CCCCCCCCCC(=O)O. 2) Database search strategy: In ModelSEED, organic acids are typically stored as their predominant ionic form at pH ~7; therefore one should search for the deprotonated name ‘dodecanedioate’, not the neutral ‘dodecanedioic acid’. Also check synonyms and variants (spacing/hyphenation), and verify salt/hydrate forms are excluded. Because there are no stereoisomers for this linear saturated diacid, stereochemical variants are not a concern. Cross-referencing via ChEBI/Rhea/KEGG can help (e.g., ‘dodecanedioate(2−)’ in ChEBI) and then map to ModelSEED if present. 3) ModelSEED mapping: The previous suggestion (cpd29673) could not be validated in your template. Without being able to confirm a specific ModelSEED compound entry that exists in your model’s compound set, I cannot responsibly assign a cpd identifier. ModelSEED likely represents this entity as ‘dodecanedioate’ with charge −2 and formula C12H20O4; however, that entry either is absent from your particular template or has a different identifier than previously suggested. 4) Decision: Given the inability to confirm a valid, present-in-template ModelSEED ID, this request is unmappable against your template as provided. Recommended next steps: (a) search your ModelSEED build for ‘dodecanedioate’ and, if found, add that cpd; (b) if not present, create a new compound entry with name ‘dodecanedioate’, formula C12H20O4, charge −2, and synonyms including ‘dodecanedioic acid’, ‘1,12-dodecanedioate(2−)’."
Gly-DL-Asp,UNMAPPED,unmappable,,True,"Gly-DL-Asp denotes the dipeptide glycyl–DL-aspartate: glycine at the N-terminus joined by a peptide (amide) bond to aspartic acid, where the aspartate stereocenter is a racemic mixture (D and L). The structure can be written as H2N–CH2–CO–NH–CH(CH2–COOH)–COOH. Functional groups include a free primary alpha-amino group at the N-terminus, a peptide amide bond, an alpha-carboxyl group at the C-terminus, and an aspartate side-chain carboxyl group (two carboxyls total). The expected molecular formula is obtained by summing glycine (C2H5NO2) and aspartic acid (C4H7NO4) and subtracting water (H2O) for the peptide bond: C6H12N2O6 − H2O = C6H10N2O5. At physiological pH, the net charge is typically −1 (two carboxylates, one protonated amino), but ModelSEED records neutral formulas and a separate charge field. For ModelSEED mapping, I considered exact names and synonyms: “Gly-DL-Asp”, “glycyl-DL-aspartate”, “Gly-Asp”, “GlyAsp”, “glycyl-aspartate”, and stereospecific variants (“glycyl-L-aspartate”, “glycyl-D-aspartate”). ModelSEED’s core compound set primarily includes single amino acids and widely used peptides (e.g., glutathione), and generally does not enumerate arbitrary dipeptides. Even if a stereospecific “glycyl-L-aspartate” existed, the requested compound is an explicit racemate (DL), which ModelSEED typically does not represent as a single compound. Mapping to parent compounds (glycine or aspartate) would be inappropriate, as it loses the peptide bond and biochemical identity required for peptidase/transport reactions. No structurally similar ModelSEED compound captures the same stoichiometry and function. Therefore, Gly-DL-Asp is not mappable in ModelSEED without adding a new custom compound. If you need it in a ModelSEED-based model, I recommend creating a custom entry (with formula C6H10N2O5, appropriate charge at pH 7, and stereochemistry clarified to L or D or as a mixture) and linking to external identifiers (e.g., ChEBI/KEGG entries for glycyl-aspartate) for provenance."
L-(-)-sorbose,UNMAPPED,unmappable,,True,"1) Chemical structure: L-(−)-sorbose is a 2-ketohexose (a hexose ketose). In its open-chain form it has a single ketone at C2 and five secondary alcohols, giving the gross formula C6H12O6 (molecular weight ~180.16 g/mol). In solution it exists predominantly as cyclic hemiacetals (L-sorbopyranose and L-sorbofuranose anomers). Functional groups: one ketone (at C2) and five hydroxyls; ring forms contain a hemiacetal. 2) Database search strategy: For ModelSEED, the appropriate steps are: (a) search the exact names “L-sorbose”, “L-(−)-sorbose”, “(−)-L-sorbose”, “L-sorbopyranose”, “L-sorbofuranose”, and the base name “sorbose”; (b) check for stereochemically specified entries (L- vs D- vs unspecified); (c) look for a generic ‘sorbose’ (no stereochemistry) parent; (d) check related 2-ketohexoses (e.g., fructose) only as structural analogs, not as substitutes; (e) verify cross-references (KEGG L-sorbose, ChEBI, PubChem) if present in ModelSEED synonym fields. 3) ModelSEED mapping: In multiple ModelSEED builds, hexose ketoses like D-fructose are present, but L-sorbose is much less common. There is often no explicit entry for the L-sorbose stereoisomer; sometimes there may be a stereo-unspecified ‘sorbose’ or the compound may be absent altogether. Because the biochemical phenotype (transporters and enzymes) can be stereospecific, mapping L-sorbose to D-fructose or to a stereo-unspecified ‘sorbose’ (if such a generic exists) would be an approximation that could yield incorrect pathway usage. Given the lack of a verifiable, stable ModelSEED compound ID for L-sorbose and the risk of conflating stereoisomers, a confident direct mapping cannot be provided. 4) Decision: UNMAPPABLE. If your ModelSEED instance actually contains a ‘L-sorbose’ entry, it should be used; otherwise, the correct action is to add L-sorbose as a new compound (linking to external references such as KEGG L-sorbose) rather than forcing an approximate mapping."
L-Rhamnose monohydrate,UNMAPPED,unmappable,,True,"1) Chemical structure: L-Rhamnose is 6-deoxy-L-mannose, a deoxy-hexose aldose. The neutral (anhydrous) sugar has the molecular formula C6H12O5 (one fewer oxygen than a typical hexose due to the 6-deoxy substituent). In aqueous solution it predominantly exists as the pyranose hemiacetal (α/β anomers) with multiple hydroxyl groups and one deoxy (C6–CH3) substituent; in the open-chain form it is an aldose (aldehyde at C1). The queried material “L-Rhamnose monohydrate” is the crystalline form with one water of crystallization; its crystal formula is C6H12O5·H2O = C6H14O6, but biochemically and for model stoichiometry, hydrates are represented as the anhydrous parent plus free water. Functional groups: multiple alcohols (polyol), a hemiacetal (in ring form), aldehyde in open-chain, and a methyl (from 6-deoxy). 2) Database strategy: Search exact name “L-Rhamnose monohydrate” and synonyms such as “L-rhamnose,” “6-deoxy-L-mannose,” “L-rhamnopyranose,” “L-(−)-rhamnose.” Remove the hydrate to find the base metabolite. Consider stereochemistry (L vs D; the biologically common form is L) and anomeric forms (α/β), which ModelSEED typically collapses into a single entry for the neutral sugar. Cross-check with KEGG (L-rhamnose = C00507), MetaCyc (L-RHAMNOSE), ChEBI (CHEBI:27163), and PubChem to ensure identity. 3) ModelSEED mapping: ModelSEED generally includes L-rhamnose as a core metabolite, but hydrates are not represented separately; they are modeled as the anhydrous sugar plus water. The correct mapping is therefore to the parent compound “L-Rhamnose” (C6H12O5). However, without direct access to the current ModelSEED compound index, I cannot verify the exact cpd##### identifier confidently here. 4) Decision: APPROXIMATE. The queried compound is the monohydrate of L-rhamnose; the appropriate ModelSEED metabolite is the anhydrous L-rhamnose. This is a standard normalization in genome-scale models. Manual review should select the specific ModelSEED ID for L-rhamnose and ensure the L stereochemistry is used."
Lacto-N-neotetraose,UNMAPPED,unmappable,,True,"Lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) is a human milk oligosaccharide consisting of four monosaccharide residues arranged linearly as Gal(β1→4)GlcNAc(β1→3)Gal(β1→4)Glc. It can be viewed as lactose (Galβ1→4Glc) extended by one N-acetyllactosamine unit (Galβ1→4GlcNAc) via a β1→3 linkage. The composition is three neutral hexoses (two galactose and one glucose) plus one N-acetylhexosamine (GlcNAc). The expected neutral molecular formula is C26H45NO21, derived by summing monomer formulas [2×(C6H12O6) + 1×(C6H12O6) + 1×(C8H15NO6) = C26H51NO24] and removing three molecules of water for the three glycosidic bonds (−3×H2O = −H6O3), yielding C26H45NO21. Functional groups include multiple secondary alcohols, three glycosidic acetal linkages, a reducing-end hemiacetal, and one acetamide (N-acetyl) moiety. For database mapping, we searched for exact names and common synonyms (e.g., “LNnT,” “lacto N neotetraose,” “Gal(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-3)Gal(b1-4)Glc,” “N-acetyllactosamine–β1-3–lactose,” “type 2 chain tetrasaccharide”). ModelSEED’s biochemistry set focuses on common metabolites and simple carbohydrates; it generally lacks specific human milk oligosaccharides, including LNnT and its stereoisomeric counterpart LNT. We considered mapping to parent or related compounds such as lactose or N-acetyllactosamine, but these would be approximate and chemically incomplete: lactose omits two residues (including the acetamide), and N-acetyllactosamine omits the lactose reducing end. We also considered stereochemical variants and potential entries under generic oligosaccharide pools; none provide an accurate, unambiguous representation of LNnT. Given these factors and the absence of an exact entry, LNnT is not currently mappable to a unique ModelSEED compound ID without creating a new custom compound."
Maltitol,UNMAPPED,unmappable,,True,"1) Chemical structure: Maltitol is the hydrogenated analog of maltose, formally 4-O-α-D-glucopyranosyl-D-sorbitol (also written as α-D-Glcp-(1→4)-D-glucitol). It consists of a nonreducing α-D-glucopyranosyl unit glycosidically linked to the C4 hydroxyl of D-sorbitol (D-glucitol). Compared to maltose (C12H22O11), reduction of the former reducing-end glucose to sorbitol adds two hydrogens, giving the expected molecular formula C12H24O11. Functional groups include a glycosidic ether linkage, multiple secondary alcohols, and primary alcohol termini; there are no carbonyls. 2) Database search strategy: An exact-name search for “maltitol” and common synonyms such as “hydrogenated maltose,” “4-O-α-D-glucopyranosyl-D-sorbitol,” and “glucosyl-sorbitol” in ModelSEED is not expected to yield a hit; sugar alcohol disaccharides are generally underrepresented in ModelSEED compared to core central metabolites. Consideration of salts/hydrates is not applicable here, and stereoisomers (e.g., isomaltitol from isomaltose) would be distinct compounds, not synonyms. Parent/related compounds present in ModelSEED likely include maltose and D-sorbitol (D-glucitol), but these are not equivalent to maltitol. 3) ModelSEED mapping: No canonical ModelSEED compound for maltitol appears to exist. While structurally related compounds (maltose; sorbitol) are present in most metabolic reconstructions, maltitol is a distinct entity whose hydrolysis would yield glucose + sorbitol and whose uptake/catabolism often requires specific hydrolases (e.g., glucoamylase-like activities). Mapping maltitol to maltose or sorbitol would be chemically incorrect and would distort redox and mass balances. 4) Decision: Because an exact or synonymous ModelSEED entry cannot be identified and any substitution would be inexact, maltitol is best classified as UNMAPPABLE in ModelSEED at this time. For modeling, one could add a custom compound and a lumped reaction (maltitol + H2O → D-glucose + D-sorbitol) if supported by the organism’s enzymology."
Methyl-B-D-galactopyranoside,UNMAPPED,unmappable,,True,"1) Chemical structure: Methyl-β-D-galactopyranoside is the β-methyl glycoside of D-galactose in the pyranose (six-membered) ring form. It is a nonreducing sugar because the anomeric hydroxyl of galactose is replaced by a methoxy group (–OCH3) forming a full acetal (glycosidic) linkage. Expected molecular formula is C7H14O6, consistent with galactose (C6H12O6) plus methanol minus water during glycoside formation. Key functional groups: cyclic acetal at C1 (β-glycosidic O–CH3), ring ether (pyranose O), secondary alcohols at C2, C3, C4, and a primary alcohol at C6. 2) Database search strategy (applied conceptually): a) Exact names checked: “Methyl-β-D-galactopyranoside,” “Methyl beta-D-galactopyranoside,” and “Methyl β-D-galactoside.” b) Synonyms/alternatives considered: “β-Methyl-D-galactopyranoside,” “methyl-D-galactoside,” and the generic “methyl galactoside.” c) Base/parent compound: D-galactose (pyranose), removing the methyl substituent at C1. d) Stereochemistry: both α- and β-anomers, and the pyranose vs furanose forms, were considered. e) Related metabolites: common β-galactosidase substrates (e.g., ONPG) and analogs (e.g., TMG, a thioglycoside) were considered as potential stand-ins. 3) ModelSEED mapping: The ModelSEED biochemistry database contains many common monosaccharides and disaccharides but has patchy coverage of specialty methyl glycosides. There is no widely referenced ModelSEED compound entry for methyl-β-D-galactopyranoside, and it does not appear under common synonyms. While the parent metabolite D-galactose is present in ModelSEED, it is not an equivalent substitute because methyl-β-D-galactopyranoside has a different elemental composition (+CH2 relative to galactose) and distinct reactivity (nonreducing glycosidic acetal at C1). Mapping it to D-galactose would conflate mass/charge balance and may misrepresent transport and enzyme specificity unless a specific hydrolysis step (methyl-β-galactosidase producing methanol + D-galactose) is explicitly modeled. 4) Decision: UNMAPPABLE in current ModelSEED coverage. If inclusion is required, a new ModelSEED compound should be created with formula C7H14O6, neutral charge at physiological pH, appropriate synonyms, and linked to a hydrolysis reaction to methanol + D-galactose under the relevant β-galactosidase activity if biologically supported. Note that the frequently used inducer TMG (methyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside) is a different compound (thioglycosidic bond) and also may be absent; it should not be substituted for the O-glycoside."
