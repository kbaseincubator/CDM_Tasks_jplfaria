## Overview

This document summarizes the manual corrections applied to fix incorrect AI-generated ModelSEED mappings from Round 2 (GPT-4o). The corrections were based on manual review and validation against the ModelSEED template file (GramNegModelTemplateV6.json).

## Corrections Applied

### Successfully Corrected (9 compounds)

These compounds were manually corrected and successfully mapped to valid ModelSEED IDs that exist in the template:

| Carbon Source | Old (Wrong) | New (Correct) | Compound Name | Formula |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| 1,5-Pentanediol | cpd19020 (Allantoin) | **UNMAPPED** | N/A | N/A |
| 3-methyl-2-oxopentanoic acid | cpd11493 (ACP) | **cpd00508** | 3MOP | C6H9O3 |
| 4-Methyl-2-oxovaleric acid | cpd11493 (ACP) | **cpd00200** | 4MOP | C6H9O3 |
| D-Glucosamine Hydrochloride | cpd00122 (N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine) | **cpd00276** | GLUM | C6H14NO5 |
| D-Raffinose pentahydrate | cpd00795 (2-Hydroxyglutarate) | **cpd00382** | Melitose | C18H32O16 |
| Sodium adipate | cpd00751 (L-Fucose) | **cpd03642** | Adipate | C6H8O4 |
| palatinose hydrate | cpd19020 (Allantoin) | **cpd01200** | Palatinose | C12H22O11 |
| Sodium octanoate | cpd00211 (Butyrate, C4) | **cpd03846** | octanoate | C8H15O2 |
| D-(-)-tagatose | cpd00751 (L-Fucose) | **cpd00589** | D-Tagatose | C6H12O6 |

### Marked as UNMAPPED (7 compounds)

These compounds were suggested in manual review but do not exist in the ModelSEED template (GramNegModelTemplateV6.json) and therefore cannot be used in FBA simulations:

| Carbon Source | Suggested ID | Why UNMAPPED |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1,4-Butanediol | cpd23934 | Not in template |
| 4-Hydroxyvalerate | cpd31889 | Not in template |
| 5-Keto-D-Gluconic Acid potassium salt | cpd00781 | Not in template |
| Azelaic acid | cpd05177 | Not in template |
| D-Maltose monohydrate | cpd00179 | Not in template |
| Lactitol | cpd37280 | Not in template |
| Suberic acid | cpd05193 | Not in template |

## Impact on CDMSCI-199 FBA Simulations

### Final Mapping Statistics

- **Total carbon sources**: 140 (after Sucrose exclusion)
- **Successfully mapped**: 122 (87.1%)
- **Unmapped**: 18 (12.9%)

### Breakdown by Source

| Mapping Round | Count | Status |
|---------------|-------|--------|
| Round 1 (Automated) | 86 | All reliable |
| Round 2 (GPT-4o) corrected | 36 | Corrected or UNMAPPED |
| Round 2 (GPT-4o) correct | 0 | N/A |
| Already UNMAPPED (Round 2/4) | 18 | Still UNMAPPED |

### FBA Simulation Coverage

- **Total possible comparisons**: 6,160 (44 organisms × 140 sources)
- **Covered by models**: 5,368 (44 organisms × 122 sources) = **87.1%**
- **Lost to unmapping**: 792 (44 organisms × 18 sources) = **12.9%**

## Key Corrections Explained

### 1. Chain Length Mismatch: Sodium octanoate

**Problem**: Octanoate (C8, 8 carbons) incorrectly mapped to Butyrate (C4, 4 carbons)
**Old**: cpd00211 (Butyrate, C4H7O2)
**New**: cpd03846 (octanoate, C8H15O2)
**Note**: Octanoate was already correctly mapped in Round 1!

### 2. Wrong Compound Class: Sodium adipate

**Problem**: Adipate (dicarboxylic acid) incorrectly mapped to L-Fucose (deoxyhexose sugar)
**Old**: cpd00751 (L-Fucose, C6H12O5)
**New**: cpd03642 (Adipate, C6H8O4)
**Impact**: Different compound class, wrong functional group

### 3. Sugar Stereoisomer: D-(-)-tagatose

**Problem**: D-(-)-tagatose incorrectly mapped to L-Fucose
**Old**: cpd00751 (L-Fucose, C6H12O5)
**New**: cpd00589 (D-Tagatose, C6H12O6)
**Note**: D-Tagatose was already correctly mapped in Round 1!

### 4. Amino Sugar Derivative: D-Glucosamine Hydrochloride

**Problem**: Glucosamine (no acetyl group) mapped to N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine
**Old**: cpd00122 (N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine, C8H15NO6)
**New**: cpd00276 (GLUM, C6H14NO5)
**Impact**: Missing acetyl group changes metabolism

### 5. Nitrogen Compound Mismatch: 1,5-Pentanediol, Lactitol, palatinose

**Problem**: Sugar alcohols/disaccharides mapped to Allantoin (nitrogen-rich uric acid derivative)
**Old**: cpd19020 (Allantoin, C4H6N4O3)
**New**:
- 1,5-Pentanediol → UNMAPPED (not in template)
- Lactitol → UNMAPPED (not in template)
- palatinose hydrate → cpd01200 (Palatinose, C12H22O11)

## Verification

### Template Validation

All corrected compound IDs were verified against:
- **File**: `/Users/jplfaria/Projects/CDM_Tasks_jplfaria/CDMSCI-193-rbtnseq-modeling/references/build_metabolic_model/GramNegModelTemplateV6.json`
- **Compounds in template**: 6,573
- **Verification method**: Direct lookup in template compound list

### Media File Regeneration

- **Old media files**: Deleted
- **New media files created**: 122
- **Carbon sources skipped (UNMAPPED)**: 18
- **Format verification**: Spot-checked Sodium_octanoate.json - correctly uses cpd03846

---

## Files Modified

1. **results/carbon_source_mapping.csv**
   - 16 rows updated with manual corrections
   - 9 successfully corrected to valid template compounds
   - 7 marked as UNMAPPED (not in template)

2. **media/*.json** (122 files)
   - All regenerated with corrected ModelSEED IDs
   - Format: Base nutrients + single carbon source at -5 mmol/gDW/hr

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong in Round 2

1. **LLM Hallucination**: GPT-4o assigned multiple different compounds to the same ModelSEED ID
2. **No Formula Validation**: No automated check that source formula matched target formula
3. **Over-confidence**: LLM marked incorrect mappings as "High" confidence

### Improvements for Future Mapping

1. **Always validate against template**: Even if compound exists in ModelSEED, must be in template
2. **Formula matching required**: Automated check that chemical formulas match
3. **Cross-reference duplicates**: Flag when multiple sources map to same ID
4. **Use GPT-5 for validation**: Better reasoning about chemical structures
